The Dog

The Dog, a blur of fur and gleam,
Through misty veils, a fleeting dream.
He runs, a shadow in the gray,
Where sunlight fades and shadows sway.

I love the Dog, his joyful pace,
A wild abandon, a happy chase.
He dances through the swirling white,
A phantom form in fading light.

And makes me go, a puzzled sigh,
A question mark within my eye.
I dunno why, this simple sight,
Can stir my soul with pure delight.

The fog, the Dog, a mystery,
A bond unseen, a harmony.
He pulls me in, his spirit free,
And I am lost, contentedly.
