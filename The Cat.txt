The Cat

A feline sleek, with emerald eyes,
A hunter's grace, a silent prize.
A bat held tight, a weapon keen,
A shadow's dance, a deadly scene.

Upon a hat, a curious sight,
A rat's demise, in fading light.
The velvet paws, a gentle tread,
The whisker twitch, a hunter fed.

The bat descends, a swift attack,
The rat's small squeak, a final crack.
The cat observes, with haughty stare,
A victor's pose, beyond compare.

A midnight game, a playful chase,
A furry friend, in time and space.
The bat, the hat, the rat's despair,
The cat's domain, beyond compare.
